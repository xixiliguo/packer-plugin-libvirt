<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/libvirt/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_skip_cache` (bool) - Use iso from provided url. Qemu must support
  curl block device. This defaults to `false`.

- `hypervisor` (string) - The hypervisor type to use when running the VM.
  This may be `kvm`, `qemu`, `xen`. The default value is kvm

- `disk_additional_size` ([]string) - Additional disks to create. Uses `vm_name` as the disk name template and
  appends `-#` where `#` is the position in the array. `#` starts at 1 since 0
  is the default disk. Each string represents the disk image size in bytes.
  Optional suffixes 'k' or 'K' (kilobyte, 1024), 'M' (megabyte, 1024k), 'G'
  (gigabyte, 1024M), 'T' (terabyte, 1024G), 'P' (petabyte, 1024T) and 'E'
  (exabyte, 1024P)  are supported. 'b' is ignored. Per qemu-img documentation.
  Each additional disk uses the same disk parameters as the default disk.
  Unset by default.

- `cpus` (int) - The number of cpus to use when building the VM.
   The default is `1` CPU.

- `disk_interface` (string) - The interface to use for the disk. Allowed values include any of `ide`,
  `scsi`, `virtio` or `virtio-scsi`^\*. Note also that any boot commands
  or kickstart type scripts must have proper adjustments for resulting
  device names. The Qemu builder uses `virtio` by default.
  
  ^\* Please be aware that use of the `scsi` disk interface has been
  disabled by Red Hat due to a bug described
  [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019220). If you are
  running Qemu on RHEL or a RHEL variant such as CentOS, you *must* choose
  one of the other listed interfaces. Using the `scsi` interface under
  these circumstances will cause the build to fail.

- `disk_size` (string) - The size in bytes of the hard disk of the VM. Suffix with the first
  letter of common byte types. Use "k" or "K" for kilobytes, "M" for
  megabytes, G for gigabytes, and T for terabytes. If no value is provided
  for disk_size, Packer uses a default of `40960M` (40 GB). If a disk_size
  number is provided with no units, Packer will default to Megabytes.

- `skip_resize_disk` (bool) - Packer resizes the QCOW2 image using
  qemu-img resize.  Set this option to true to disable resizing.
  Defaults to false.

- `disk_cache` (string) - The cache mode to use for disk. Allowed values include any of
  `writethrough`, `writeback`, `none`, `unsafe` or `directsync`. By
  default, this is set to `writeback`.

- `disk_discard` (string) - The discard mode to use for disk. Allowed values
  include any of unmap or ignore. By default, this is set to ignore.

- `disk_detect_zeroes` (string) - The detect-zeroes mode to use for disk.
  Allowed values include any of unmap, on or off. Defaults to off.
  When the value is "off" we don't set the flag in the qemu command, so that
  Packer still works with old versions of QEMU that don't have this option.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - Packer compacts the QCOW2 image using
  qemu-img convert.  Set this option to true to disable compacting.
  Defaults to false.

- `disk_compression` (bool) - Apply compression to the QCOW2 disk file
  using qemu-img convert. Defaults to false.

- `format` (string) - Either `qcow2` or `raw`, this specifies the output format of the virtual
  machine image. This defaults to `qcow2`.

- `disk_image` (bool) - Packer defaults to building from an ISO file, this parameter controls
  whether the ISO URL supplied is actually a bootable QEMU image. When
  this value is set to `true`, the machine will either clone the source or
  use it as a backing file (if `use_backing_file` is `true`); then, it
  will resize the image according to `disk_size` and boot it.

- `qemu_img_args` (QemuImgArgs) - A map of custom arguments to pass to qemu-img commands, where the key
  is the subcommand, and the values are lists of strings for each flag.
  Example:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  {
   "qemu_img_args": {
     "convert": ["-o", "preallocation=full"],
  	  "resize": ["-foo", "bar"]
   }
  ```
  Please note
  that unlike qemuargs, these commands are not split into switch-value
  sub-arrays, because the basic elements in qemu-img calls are  unlikely
  to need an actual override.
  The arguments will be constructed as follows:
  - Convert:
  	Default is `qemu-img convert -O $format $sourcepath $targetpath`. Adding
  	arguments ["-foo", "bar"] to qemu_img_args.convert will change this to
  	`qemu-img convert -foo bar -O $format $sourcepath $targetpath`
  - Create:
  	Default is `create -f $format $targetpath $size`. Adding arguments
  	["-foo", "bar"] to qemu_img_args.create will change this to
  	"create -f qcow2 -foo bar target.qcow2 1234M"
  - Resize:
  	Default is `qemu-img resize -f $format $sourcepath $size`. Adding
  	arguments ["-foo", "bar"] to qemu_img_args.resize will change this to
  	`qemu-img resize -f $format -foo bar $sourcepath $size`

- `use_backing_file` (bool) - Only applicable when disk_image is true
  and format is qcow2, set this option to true to create a new QCOW2
  file that uses the file located at iso_url as a backing file. The new file
  will only contain blocks that have changed compared to the backing file, so
  enabling this option can significantly reduce disk usage. If true, Packer
  will force the `skip_compaction` also to be true as well to skip disk
  conversion which would render the backing file feature useless.

- `libvirt_addr` (string) - The communacation address of libvirt. By default, this is
  /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock

- `arch` (string) - The OS arch of emulation to use. Run `virsh capabilities` to
  list available types for your system. This defaults to `x86_64`.

- `machine_type` (string) - The type of machine emulation to use. Run `virsh capabilities` to
  list available types for  your system. This defaults to `pc`.

- `loader` (string) - The firmware which is specified by absolute path.
  It is useful when VM boot on UEFI Mode

- `cpu_mode` (string) - The CPU Mode to configure a guest CPU to be as close to host CPU as possible
  Allowed values `host-passthrough`, `host-model` and other value
  `host-passthrough` generate the following xml
  <cpu mode='host-passthrough'>
  </cpu>
  `cortex-a57` generate the following xml
  <cpu mode='custom'>
  	<model>cortex-a57</mode>
  </cpu>

- `emulator_binary` (string) - The binary of emulator to use. Run `virsh capabilities` to
  list available value for your system. This defaults to `/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm`.

- `memory` (int) - The amount of memory to use when building the VM
  in megabytes. This defaults to 512 megabytes.

- `net_device` (string) - The driver to use for the network interface. Allowed values `ne2k_pci`,
  `i82551`, `i82557b`, `i82559er`, `rtl8139`, `e1000`, `pcnet`, `virtio`,
  `virtio-net`, `virtio-net-pci`, `usb-net`, `i82559a`, `i82559b`,
  `i82559c`, `i82550`, `i82562`, `i82557a`, `i82557c`, `i82801`,
  `vmxnet3`, `i82558a` or `i82558b`. The Qemu builder uses `virtio-net` by
  default.

- `net_bridge` (string) - Connects the network to this bridge
  
  **NB** This bridge must already exist. libvirt use `virbr0` bridge
  as default
  
  **NB** This only works in Linux based OSes.

- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the
  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.
  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when packer
  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running
  the builder. By default this is output-BUILDNAME where "BUILDNAME" is the
  name of the build.

- `xml_file` (string) - Allow to control libvirt by customized xml
  This is a template engine and allows access to the following
  variables: {{ .HTTPIP }}, {{ .HTTPPort }}, {{ .HTTPDir }}, {{ .OutputDir }},
  and {{ .Name }}

- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address that should be
  binded to for VNC. By default packer will use 127.0.0.1 for this. If you
  wish to bind to all interfaces use 0.0.0.0.

- `vnc_use_password` (bool) - Whether or not to set a password on the VNC server. This option
  automatically enables the QMP socket. See `qmp_socket_path`. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum and maximum port
  to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. The builder uses VNC to type
  the initial boot_command. Because Packer generally runs in parallel,
  Packer uses a randomly chosen port in this range that appears available. By
  default this is 5900 to 6000. The minimum and maximum ports are inclusive.

- `vnc_port_max` (int) - VNC Port Max

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the image (QCOW2 or IMG) file for
  the new virtual machine. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where
  "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build. Currently, no file extension will be
  used unless it is specified in this option.

- `cdrom_interface` (string) - The interface to use for the CDROM device which contains the ISO image.
  Allowed values include any of `ide`, `scsi`, `virtio` or
  `virtio-scsi`. The Qemu builder uses `virtio` by default.
  Some ARM64 images require `virtio-scsi`.
